# 1 Development Environment Setup

React projects can be scaffolded quickly. The classic tool is Create React App (CRA), which hides webpack configuration and provides a ready-to-use setup.

```bash
npx create-react-app react-basic
```

- `npx`: Node.js tool that locates and executes the following package command.
- `create-react-app`: The core package that scaffolds a React project.
- `react-basic`: Your project name; change as needed.

## Notes
- CRA is no longer the recommended default for new apps; consider Vite or Next.js for modern builds.
- Keep Node.js updated; many tools rely on recent versions.
